[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/easytechglobal/windows-containers/_apis/build/status%2Fdavid-garcia-garcia.windowscontainers?branchName=refs%2Fpull%2F20%2Fmerge)](https://dev.azure.com/easytechglobal/windows-containers/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

# Windows Containers

Several docker images that support hosting Windows based applications in a reliable and production ready way.

Because of MSSQL Server EULA, the images containing the MSSQL binaries cannot be uploaded.

These all are **unofficial**, **unsupported** and **in no way connected to Microsoft**.

## Quick Start

This repository contains multiple images that cannot be pushed to public repositories due to EULA of some of the software used in the build process. You will have to build and push them to a private repository in order to get started (or you can just test them locally)

Some of these images have dependencies between them.

There is a script to build and push all of the images to a private repository in the root, just run the buildall.ps1 script.

Make sure to replace the URL to your private repository in the script, and that you are authenticated to push images:

```powershell
# Rename envsettings.ps1.template to envsettings.ps1 and complete build params
# https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-docker/issues/540
$Env:MSSQLINSTALL_ISO_URL = "https://xx.blob.core.windows.net/software/mssql.iso";
$Env:MSSQLINSTALL_CU_URL = "https://xx.blob.core.windows.net/software/cu.exe";
$Env:MSSQLINSTALL_CUFIX_URL = "https://xx.blob.core.windows.net/software/cufix.7z";
$ENV:REGISTRY_PATH = "myregistry.azurecr.io/core/"
$ENV:IMAGE_VERSION = "1.0.32";
$ENV:TESTS_SAS_URL = "https://xx.blob.core.windows.net/mytests";

# Build the images
.\buildall.ps1

# Build and push to the registry
.\buildall.ps1 -Push

# Build and run tests
.\buildall.ps1 -Test
```

## Image List

## Debugging the powershell code

To debug the powershell code in the different images, you use the helper method import functions:

```
. .\importfunctions.ps1   
```

Just remember to call this method again every time you change the implementation of any of the helper functions.

## Azure Pipelines Integration

The included azure pipeline integration needs the following variables:

| Name                   | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| MSSQLINSTALL_CU_URL    | Url to the cumulative update installer                       |
| MSSQLINSTALL_CUFIX_URL | Url to the cumulative update fix package (https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-docker/issues/540) |
| MSSQLINSTALL_ISO_URL   | Url to the MS SQL Server ISO image                           |
| REGISTRY_USER          | Container registry username                                  |
| REGISTRY_PWD           | Container registry password                                  |
| REGISTRY_PATH          | Container registry URL with prefix, i.e. "myimages.azurecr.io/core" |
| TESTS_SAS_URL          | An azure Blob Storage SAS URL, use during testing to verify backup and restore automation to Azure Blob |

The images are tagged in the registry using the branch/tag name of the current build.

You can have some control of how the build works using commit messages with the following keywords

| Keyword (must insert between square brackets []) | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| notest                                           | Skips the testing step                                       |
| push                                             | Pushes the images to the container registry. Not needed for tags, which are automatically pushed. |
