# Microsoft SQL Server 2022 base image - For Kubernetes

This image has configurable behavior based on two concepts:

* **Lifecycle**: through env, you will set a Lifecycle type, this will tell the container how to persistent data lifecycle will be managed.
* **Control operations**: through a control file, you can setup one-time startup commands to run on the container.

## Instance Startup Configuration

Use MSSQL_SPCONFIGURE to run SPCONFIGURE on boot, if any of the changes requires a restart, the script will detect it and restart.

```yaml
MSSQL_SPCONFIGURE=max degree of parallelism:1;backup compression default:1
```

## Backup and Maintenance

The image comes with a well known backup solution already installed:

[SQL Server Backup (hallengren.com)](https://ola.hallengren.com/sql-server-backup.html)

## Master key

A master key with a random password is automatically deployed on start. If this is a persistent setup and a master key already exists, none will be deployed.

## Monitoring Backup and Restores

There is nothing more frustrating when automating database lifecycles than having zero visibility on the state of restores and backups.

To deal with that, a background job is deployed on startup that logs to the Event Viewer every 8 seconds the current state of any backup or restore operation, including information about completed percentage.

## Monitoring 

### Setup

Monitoring configuration is setup and periodically refreshed through a scheduled task "DeployMssqlNri".

This task:

* Deploys the backup summary table and populating job using SbsDeployDbBackupInfo

* Setups the newrelic identity in the SQL engine using SbsAddNriMonitor
* Configure the newrelic authentication (mssql-config.yml)

To run this immediately after booting use the env configuration:

```yaml
SBS_CRONRUNONBOOT=DeployMssqlNri
```

### Backup State for databases

The image has a Job "RefreshSbsDatabaseBackupInfo" and a table in Master "SbsDatabaseBackupInfo". This job populates the table with summarized backup information for all databases in the SQL engine that you can use to monitor database backup status.

The new relic MSSQL integration in the image is already configured to push this information to New Relic (see mssql-custom-query.yml) so you can build integrated monitoring panels for MSSQL in New Relic

Special mention to the backupByDb_modified column, that shows the amount of pages modified since last full backup. This is important if you are using differential to full promotion during backups according to % percentage.

You can now use this information to create a faceted new relic alert that warns you when backups are not working, i.e.

```sql
SELECT max(backupByDb_sinceFull) as 'H since Full' FROM MssqlCustomQuerySample where backupByDb_sinceFull is not null FACET db_Database as Database
```

## SQL Server Agent

The SQL Server Agent is installed and configured, but **disabled** by default.

To enable the agent add the service name to the list of start on boot services in ENV:

```yaml
SBS_SRVENSURE=SQLSERVERAGENT
```

## Lifecycle

The lifecycle determines "how" the image intends to treat persistent data and configuration. I.E. you might totally want to have a configuration-free MSSQL setup where the only persistent thing are the data files themselves. On the other hand, you might want to have total control on the SQL Instance and have any config change you make to it persisted.

### **Persistent**

This is the most simple lifecycle possible, it mostly leaves the base image behavior untouched.

Focusing on the minimum ENV setup needed for this:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - "f:/databases/example/data:d:"
    networks:
      - container_default
    environment:
      - MSSQL_ADMIN_USERNAME=sa
      - MSSQL_ADMIN_PWD=sapwd
      - MSSQL_LIFECYCLE=PERSISTENT
      - MSSQL_PATH_DATA=d:\data
      - MSSQL_PATH_LOG=d:\log
      - MSSQL_PATH_BACKUP=d:\backup
      - MSSQL_PATH_CONTROL=d:\control
      - MSSQL_PATH_SYSTEM=d:\system
      - SBS_TEMPORARY=d:\temp
```

All SQL  paths (MSSQL_PATH_*) have been moved to persistent volume store. This ensures that master, model and everything you setup in this MSSQL instance is retained and stored in persistent storage. The pod can move between nodes in K8S and will recover it's previous state with a minimum downtime. For a zero downtime pod we need to rely on replication/mirroring (pending).

## Control Operations

You can place a "startup.yaml" file in the SSQL_PATH_CONTROL path, the contents of this path will be processed once on container startup, and once done, the file renamed for archiving so it will not be processed again.

In this yaml you can have one or more operations, that will execute sequentially on boot.

**Perform a full restore**

```yaml
steps:
  - type: 'restore_full'
    url: 'https://urltomyfullbackup.bak'
    name: 'MyDatabase' # leavy empty to use ENV MSSQL_DATABASE
    cert: 'https://urltocertificatezipprotectingbackup.zip'
```

If the restore is huge, you can the the progress from the container output or the event viewer.

**Restore from bacpack**

```yaml
steps:
  - type: 'restore_bacpac'
    url: 'https://urltomyfullbackup.bacpac'
    name: 'MyDatabase' # leavy empty to use ENV MSSQL_DATABASE
```
